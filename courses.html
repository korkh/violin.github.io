			<h1>VIOLIN LESSONS</h1>
			<p>To master the violin is a bold step that not everyone dares to take. Moreover, in adulthood. What exactly is stopping you? Lack of free time, insecurity and stereotypes about age? If you come to a trial lesson at our violin school, then make sure: everything is possible. The main thing is your desire.

Yes, learning to play the violin is not easy - solfeggio, new terms, incomprehensible exercises, the need to organize time ... It will be difficult at first. But interesting. Positive and passionate music educators will work with you. They will not only teach you how to play, but will help you understand and love this fretless bowed instrument.</p></div>

			<h1>PIANO LESSONS</h1>
			<p>Even if you don't know what the notes are generally called and look like, you can still learn to play simple pieces of music on the piano. What you do next is your business. There is no limit to perfection!

You will learn musical notation. This means that you can learn your favorite melodies from the notes yourself.

Believe me, it's not difficult. Everyone doesn't have to be a great musician. But to know the basics will not be superfluous, right? What if you discover talent in yourself?

Our online piano lessons are not about making you a professional musician. The goal is to learn how to play for the soul.</p></div>

			<h1>GUITAR LESSONS</h1>
			<p>The course is designed for learning to play the guitar from scratch. In addition, the lessons of the course contain data and a specially developed methodology for effectively mastering various techniques of playing the acoustic guitar.
The lesson materials will also be interesting and useful to everyone who plays this instrument and does not stop there, to everyone who wants to develop their musical abilities.

The uniqueness of the course is in its versatility, in that it is simple, accessible and effective. It is equally well suited to people of all ages, children and adults.
No music knowledge is required for training.</p></div>
